                <p><strong>My background:</strong> I started skiing when I was 7 years old, I first learned at a
                    Pocono
                    Mountain in PA, called
                    Blue Mountain. When my skis first touched the snow, I knew I had a lifelong hobby that I
                    loved. Over
                    the
                    next 12 years, I have skied frequently and at many different places. Skiing has always been
                    an
                    escape
                    from the real world because my mind is present at the task. I’ve skied many different types
                    of skis,
                    boots, and bindings, which has given me a great understanding of gear. At every different
                    level of
                    skiing,
                    my equipment has changed, and I understand what every type of skier needs. Along with skiing
                    different
                    skis, I have also changed my type of skiing many times. With all of this knowledge I have
                    gained
                    over the
                    years, I built this website to share it with you and help you become a better skier</p>
